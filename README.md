# 🚀 Day 28: Number of Occurrence – #GFG160 Challenge
## 📌 Problem Statement

## 🧠 Approach
- We use Binary Search to efficiently find:

- The first occurrence of the target.

- The last occurrence of the target.

## 🔍 Concepts Practiced
- Binary Search

- Searching in Sorted Arrays

- Edge Case Handling (target not found)

---

## ⏱ Time & Space Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(log N)

- Space Complexity: O(1)
